    In this chapter, we have developed important representations for LTI systems, both in discrete time and in continuous time. In discrete time we derived a
    representation of signals as weighted sums of shifted unit impulsesâ€‚, and we then used this to derive the convolutionsum representation for the response of a
    discrete-time LTI system. In continuous time we.derived an analogous representation of continuous-time signals as weighted integrals of shifted unit impulses,
    and we used this to derive the convolution integral representation for continuous-time LTI systems. These representations are extremely important, as they
    allow us to compute the response of an LTI system to an arbitrary input in terms of the system's response to a unit impulse. Moreover, in Section 2.3 the 
    convolution sum and integral provided us with a means of analyzing the properties of LTI systems and, in particular, of relating LTI system properties, 
    including causality and stability, to corresponding properties of the unit impulse response. Also, in Section 2.5 we developed an interpretation of the 
    continuous-time unit impulse and other related singularity functions in terms of their behavior under convolution. This interpretation is particularly useful in 
    the analysis of LTI systems. An important class of continuous-time systems consists of those described by linear constant-coefficient differential equations.
    Similarly, in discrete time, linear constantcoefficient difference equations play an equally important role. In Section 2.4, we examined simple examples of 
    differential and difference equations and discussed some of the properties of systems described by these types of equations. In particular, systems described
    by linear constant-coefficient differential and difference equations together with the condition of initial rest are causal and LTI. In subsequent chapters, we 
    will develop additional tools that greatly facilitate our ability to analyze such systems.
